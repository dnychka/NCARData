# NCARData
Climate data used as example from  GSP/IMAGe NCAR projects 

An older web page 
https://www.image.ucar.edu/GSP/Data/US.monthly.met/
walks the reader through monthly data for temperature and precipitation 
for the US. These data were part of the original source for the monthly 
data product using the PRISM method created by Chris Daly. 
The original tar files are too large to include as git files so so the 
expanded directory are posted. 

In case the old webpage has been removed from NCAR also included is a pdf 
of the page and also the R functions that are referred to on the page. 

These data are freely available in the public domain. Just this formatting 
is original.  If you use these data, however,  please cite this source. 

DISCLAIMER:
The accuracy or reliability of the data is not guaranteed or warranted in 
any way and the providers disclaim liability of any kind whatsoever, 
including, without limitation, liability for quality, performance, 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose arising out of the 
use, or inability to use the data
