# NCARData
Climate data used as example from  GSP/IMAGe NCAR projects 

An older web page 
https://www.image.ucar.edu/GSP/Data/US.monthly.met/
walks the reader through monthly data for temperature and precipitation 
for the US. These data were part of the original source for the monthly 
data product using the PRISM method created by Chris Daly. 
The original tar files are too large to include as git files so so the 
expanded directory are posted.
