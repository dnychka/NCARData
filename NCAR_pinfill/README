Tar file of the  analysis is  

NCAR_pinfill.others.tar
available at ftp.cgd.ucar.edu/pub/nychka

To extract in UNIX

In a subdirectory 

tar -xvf NCAR_pinfill.others.tar


The complete ppt files based on regular station data have the names 

ppt.complete.Ynnn
where nnn = 001, 002, ..., 103

Precip units are in total millimeters per month and the time span is 
1895-1997. There are a total of 11918 station locations, thus  each file 
has 11918 lines. 

Metadata on these stations is found in METAinfo
columns of this file are:
 station id  longitude, latitude, elevation 

(however elevation is not used in any of the infill procedures.)

Each separate data file consists of the precipitation for a single year
each line of the file is data for one station according to the format:

station id, 12 temps ( jan-dec) , 12 missing values codes (1=missing, 0= 
present). When a data value is missing a statistically infilled value 
appears. 

Some typical lines ( starting @ 204 in ppt.complete.Y020):

017126     48  117  116  109   64   40   60  165   43   57   57  209  111111111111
017157     52  106   60  151   68   81  102  325   19   31   50  150  000000000000
017207     62  101   85  150   38   76  117  187   73   71   75  186  111111111111

and is written with the FORTRAN format statement format(a8,12I5,2x, 12I1)

Note that in UNIX there is a simple way to accumulate the results for a 
single station. 
e.g. for station with id 017366

grep 017366 ppt.complete.* > just.one.station

Of course assembling a data subset for many stations will involve looping 
over all the yearly files.
