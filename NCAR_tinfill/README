The complete temperature files have the names 

tmin.complete.Ynnn
tmax.complete.Ynnn
where nnn = 001, 002, ..., 103
temperature always appears as a integer in hundredths of degree C  


There are a total of 8125 station locations and each file has 8215 lines. 

Metadata on these stations is found in METAinfo
columns of this file are:
 station id elevation , longitude and latitude. 

Each separate data file consists of the tempertures for a single year
each line of the file is data for one station according to the format:

station id, 12 temps ( jan-dec) , 12 missing values codes (1=missing, 0= 
present). When a data value is missing a statistically infilled value 
appears. 

Typical line looks like:

010148     -3  -44   52  111  142  181  194  196  173   61   56   15  000000000000
and is written with the FORTRAN format statement format(a8,12I5,2x, 12I1)
